# Notes

To launch the code type:
```shell
python prog.py z115_1-int.txt z115_2-int.txt 8
```
Here files z115_1-int.txt and z115_2-int.txt stores one- and two-body integrals in the specific format and number 8 stands for the number of spin-orbitals to be used.

The curent launching format will be changed soon and all necessary data: number of electrons, names of the files with one- and two-body integrals, number of orbitals, type of the anzatz, and etc. will be stored in a separate file.
